Miah Jeffra examines our new and rapidly changing public life by questioning a few fundamentals—perception, memory, identity, violence, love—in all their complexity, and in their relationship to one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity and its resilience, even as it wades through divisive politics, social media and technological dissociation.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/book/first-book.md","sha":"e51f63bbfbbda969802f13bfe90e7e5fbdf1905d"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-04-05T19:06:04.833Z"}
