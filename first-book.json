Miah Jeffra examines our new and rapidly changing public life by questioning a few fundamentals—perception, memory, identity, violence, love—in all their complexity, and in their relationship to one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity and its resilience, even as it wades through divisive politics, social media and technological dissociation.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/book/first-book.md","sha":"3794dcc20816ed90b5ad43022f1d1f8ecbd5e3cb"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-12-05T21:07:08.215Z"}
