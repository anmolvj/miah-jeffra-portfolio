Miah Jeffra examines our new and rapidly changing public life by questioning a few fundamentals—perception, memory, identity, violence, love—in all their complexity, and in their relationship to one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity and its resilience, even as it wades through divisive politics, social media and technological disassociation.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/book/first-book.md","sha":"8f418a84122ce33cca6928b2147fdc7fef8aa9dd"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-05-02T16:29:06.613Z"}
