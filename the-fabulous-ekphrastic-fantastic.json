Jeffra explores the nature of gender, sexuality, aesthetics, and love, taking a tiny hammer to the stability of the limits of perception, troubling the tether between perception and memory. At once memoir and cultural criticism, this collection discovers itself as a book about forgiveness, family, and the truths we find in “the lightness of a door,” “the probability of a radio,” the long line between one story and another.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/book/the-fabulous-ekphrastic-fantastic.md","sha":"d4f07f1aacbc5f674dd5404df3a94a7b5eb9d4e5"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-04-05T19:04:50.024Z"}
