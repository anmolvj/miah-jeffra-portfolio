Jeffra explores the nature of gender, sexuality, aesthetics, and love, taking a tiny hammer to the stability of the limits of perception, troubling the tether between perception and memory. At once memoir and cultural criticism, this collection discovers itself as a book about forgiveness, family, and the truths we find in “the lightness of a door,” “the probability of a radio,” the long line between one story and another.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"src/pages/book/the-fabulous-ekphrastic-fantastic.md","sha":"345c8ff459860cc101eb10b8fa34d62412b9557e"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-02-02T20:17:18.050Z"}
