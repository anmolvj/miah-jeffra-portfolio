  In The Violence Almanac, Miah Jeffra complicates the boundaries between
  culture and nature, fiction and true-crime, desire and pain. In this powerful
  fiction debut, Jeffra takes us through the California landscape to map the
  various ways that violence emerges, terrorizes and shapes our most familiar
  social structures.


  Familiar and real, ripped from headlines yet a fiction all its own, The Violence Almanac vacillates between visceral horror and heartbreaking humanity. With a broad array of voices, these stories paint a portrait of the vastly diverse, complicated, hyper-mediated state of California and the state of ourselves, and blurs the line between safety and danger, love and obsession, victim and agent of violence.
reviews:
  - reviewerName: Andrew Sean Greer
    message: Brilliant and daring, full of horror and tenderness, The Violence
      Almanac gives us the American stories we need to be reading.
  - reviewerName: Randall Kenan
    message: "The Violence Almanac is full of complex, flawed and wonderfully alive
      characters, written with empathy and honesty. Jeffra’s love for language
      and humanity is evident in this book, yet he demands us to face the
      ugliness of our society, even in the most likeable of characters. I am
      deeply impressed by this collection and this writer. "
  - reviewerName: Publisher's Weekly
    message: Throughout these portraits of the exhausted and murderous, the
      carelessly angry, and the heartbroken and vengeful, Jeffra compassionately
      and unflinchingly depicts an array of desperate characters as they try to
      attain the lives they’ve always dreamed of. While the stories can be
      emotionally challenging, they resonate deeply.
  - reviewerName: Out in Print
    message: The Violence Almanac glitters like a dark diamond. Wholly engaging and
      as tough as it is compulsive to read, this is storytelling at its finest.
  - reviewerName: Dan Chaon
    message: The Violence Almanac is a jewel of a collection–formally inventive,
      transgressive, darkly funny at times, deeply moving at others. The stories
      bring together a variety of voices and perspectives to create  a cohesive
      and stunning portrait of contemporary America. Miah Jeffra is a true
      original, and a talent to watch.
  - reviewerName: Maxine Chernoff
    message: "Miah Jeffra’s  brilliant stories in the The Violence Almanac seethe
      with life lived close to the eyes. The unrelenting gaze of the narrators,
      who stay perhaps too long on their subjects: from a mother, based on
      Andrea Yates, systematically drowning her children to her husband, fists
      pounding the ground; from a prostitute avenging the death of her friend to
      a man trying to save a fledgling pigeon–all is included in these honest,
      incisive stories. But the gaze is only part of it; Jeffra’s goal is
      understanding the meaning of his own structures, a relentless quest for
      the hidden, the difficult, the paradoxical. Small, subtle movements from a
      twitch to a swallow are interpreted as signs. That much is broken and
      imperfect is not overlooked; it is cause for investigation and
      appreciation of the tangled truths of experience. Jeffra is a
      hyperrealist, and the stories vibrate with pain and love."
  - reviewerName: Free State Review
    message: The Violence Almanac is both a deeply unsettling and insightful book.
      The prose ranges from lyrical to matter of fact, intimately psychological
      to cooly distant, Miah Jeffra flourishing a chameleon’s grasp of style.
  - reviewerName: San Francisco Chronicle
    message: Jeffra is a master of writing that stands out in how unflinchingly it
      inhabits and experiments with abstract ideas.
  - reviewerName: Fantastic Fiction
    message: "The Violence Almanac provides a complicated and nuanced portrait of
      contemporary American violence as much as it does the multiplicity of
      California itself. "
