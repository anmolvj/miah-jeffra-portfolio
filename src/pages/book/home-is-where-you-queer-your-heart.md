description: HOME IS WHERE YOU QUEER YOUR HEART anthologizes contemporary queer
  writers and artists creatively thinking through the complex and fluid
  realities in the U.S. and abroad. Curated during the 2020 U.S. presidential
  election and the COVID-19 pandemic, as the culture shifts into a new
  normal—and many queer people feel their nation has further precluded them from
  a place of comfort—poets, essayists, storytellers, and artists remind us that
  it is at our kitchen tables, in our bedrooms, on our porches that makes us who
  we are.
