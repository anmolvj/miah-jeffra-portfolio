description: What does it mean to be American, Californian, queer, even
  creative, in an era of tweeted populism and hashtags? Miah Jeffra examines our
  new and rapidly changing public life by questioning a few
  fundamentals—perception, memory, identity, violence, love—in all their
  complexity, and in their relationship to one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S
  HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity and its resilience, even as it wades
  through divisive politics, social media and technological dissociation.
reviews:
  - reviewerName: Lambda Literary Review
    message: In First Church, loneliness and innocence, as well as sensuality and
      eroticism, exist side by side, merging effortlessly into each other.
      Jeffra doesn’t shy away from the body, and the incisiveness of his style
      forces the reader to consider their own experience as a human animal.
  - message: Miah Jeffra does not use his imagination to protect himself or to
      protect us. Instead, he gives us stories of reckless tenderness and anger
      and sorrow and lust—that overflow with images of wonder and desire. How
      wonderful!
    reviewerName: Robert Glück
  - message: A gem of an essay collection, shot through with humor, anger, and a
      deep, deep love—for men, for humanity, for language. In lush, risk-taking
      prose, Jeffra explores what it means to be queer, alive, and struggling in
      high-tech, low-empathy America. He takes the pulse of the now and quickens
      it with this sparkling debut.
    reviewerName: Janet Sarbanes
  - message: "Through these dexterously choreographed essays, Miah Jeffra perfects a
      grim exuberance that comes to suggest a new optimism. He writes: 'We made
      the Titanic, we made the Hindenburg, we made the Challenger Shuttle. We
      made Fukushima. We make love.' Certainly, the blood kinship of love and
      disaster—each here driven by human ambition for more self—animates this
      passage. But what deepens it is the breadth of Jeffra’s 'we.' There is
      generosity here despite our capacities for self-righteousness, predation,
      and social inequity. I leave The First Church of What’s Happening
      believing that what Jeffra evangelizes is resilience as a necessity, not a
      virtue."
    reviewerName: Douglas Kearney
  - message: Vision is a tricky enterprise. So writes Miah Jeffra in his sparkling
      new collection. In these lyrical essays Jeffra’s quick eye catches what we
      often glide by, slide by, forget to notice, ignore. In these true to life,
      truer than life stories he shifts our focus from the obvious, the flash,
      the façade, to the subtle, background, underground, under skin tales where
      truer, deeper meaning resides. Luminous moments that often get less
      fanfare shine forth, rendered by a narrator who doesn’t always shout look
      at me, me, me, but instead look at us, us, us. All of us; the fragile, the
      fallible, the lovely, the strange. This book not only expands our visual
      field but our intellectual, emotional and imaginative fields as well. Go
      see.
