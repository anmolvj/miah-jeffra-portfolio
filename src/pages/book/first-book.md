description: >-
  What does it mean to be American, Californian, queer, even creative, in an era
  of tweeted populism and hashtags? Miah Jeffra examines our new and rapidly
  changing public life by questioning a few fundamentals—perception, memory,
  identity, violence, love—in all their complexity, and in their relationship to
  one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity
  and its resilience, even as it wades through divisive politics, social media
  and technological disassociation.

      Miah Jeffra does not use his imagination to protect himself or to protect
      us. Instead, he gives us stories of reckless tenderness and anger and
      sorrow and lust—that overflow with images of wonder and desire. How
      wonderful!

  - message: >-
      A gem of an essay collection, shot through with humor, anger, and a deep,
      deep love—for men, for humanity, for language. In lush, risk-taking prose,
      Jeffra explores what it means to be queer, alive, and struggling in
      high-tech, low-empathy America. He takes the pulse of the now and quickens
      it with this sparkling debut.
