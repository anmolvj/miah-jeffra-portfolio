  What does it mean to be American, Californian, queer, even creative, in an era
  of tweeted populism and hashtags? Miah Jeffra examines our new and rapidly
  changing public life by questioning a few fundamentals—perception, memory,
  identity, violence, love—in all their complexity, and in their relationship to
  one other. THE FIRST CHURCH OF WHAT'S HAPPENING is a love letter to humanity
  and its resilience, even as it wades through divisive politics, social media
  and technological dissociation.

      Miah Jeffra does not use his imagination to protect himself or to protect
      us. Instead, he gives us stories of reckless tenderness and anger and
      sorrow and lust—that overflow with images of wonder and desire. How
      wonderful!
    reviewerName: Robert Glück

      A gem of an essay collection, shot through with humor, anger, and a deep,
      deep love—for men, for humanity, for language. In lush, risk-taking prose,
      Jeffra explores what it means to be queer, alive, and struggling in
      high-tech, low-empathy America. He takes the pulse of the now and quickens
      it with this sparkling debut.

      Both tough and tender, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and other times
      direly serious, Miah Jeffra flips the script in these essays on art,
      danger, seduction and sexuality. Moving between critical, narrative,
      lyrical modes Jeffra illuminates and entertains. I loved this book.

      Through these dexterously choreographed essays, Miah Jeffra perfects a
      grim exuberance that comes to suggest a new optimism. He writes: 'We made
      the Titanic, we made the Hindenburg, we made the Challenger Shuttle. We
      made Fukushima. We make love.' Certainly, the blood kinship of love and
      disaster—each here driven by human ambition for more self—animates this
      passage. But what deepens it is the breadth of Jeffra’s 'we.' There is
      generosity here despite our capacities for self-righteousness, predation,
      and social inequity. I leave The First Church of What’s Happening
      believing that what Jeffra evangelizes is resilience as a necessity, not a
      virtue.

      Miah Jeffra writes somewhere between a scream and a growl, in short
      energetic essays that queer the language in exciting ways. In a letter to
      the late Keith Haring, Jeffra writes 'I want to feel like a bandit, a
      punk, a renegade.' And indeed he takes us on an outlaw's journey,
      provocateur and picador; flaunt and flirt. Here is a writer who grabs the
      reader by the balls in all the ways one hopes to be testicularly taken.

      Vision is a tricky enterprise. So writes Miah Jeffra in his sparkling new
      collection. In these lyrical essays Jeffra’s quick eye catches what we
      often glide by, slide by, forget to notice, ignore. In these true to life,
      truer than life stories he shifts our focus from the obvious, the flash,
      the façade, to the subtle, background, underground, under skin tales where
      truer, deeper meaning resides. Luminous moments that often get less
      fanfare shine forth, rendered by a narrator who doesn’t always shout look
      at me, me, me, but instead look at us, us, us. All of us; the fragile, the
      fallible, the lovely, the strange. This book not only expands our visual
      field but our intellectual, emotional and imaginative fields as well. Go
      see.
