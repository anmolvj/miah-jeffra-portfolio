description: “A river’s edge, if approached too close, can sweep a body beyond
  itself.” In The Fabulous Ekphrastic Fantastic!, Miah Jeffra perfects
  apostrophe as canticle, a host of heroes beckoning the reader deeper into the
  waters of selfhood, Madonna, Mary Shelley, Felix Gonzalez Torres, Plato, and
  Jeffra’s mother among them. Jeffra explores the nature of gender, sexuality,
  aesthetics, and love, taking a tiny hammer to the stability of the limits of
  perception, troubling the tether between perception and memory. At once memoir
  and cultural criticism, this collection discovers itself as a book about
  forgiveness, family, and the truths we find in “the lightness of a door,” “the
  probability of a radio,” the long line between one story and another.
reviews:
  - reviewerName: Lambda Literary
    message: Is Miah Jeffra a philosopher? Is he, perhaps, a prophet? Is Miah
      Jeffra, author of The Fabulous Ekphrastic Fantastic, a loud, queer pop lit
      voice for the new dawning? The author’s collection of essays proves that
      he is all these things and more. With cadenced writing, Jeffra offers a
      fortified feast of memories, personal theories, and lessons.
  - reviewerName: Entropy
    message: At the heart of [The Fabulous Ekphrastic Fantastic!] is the knowledge
      that an artist/writer can imagine a whole person into being simply because
      they were needed, but that person won’t necessarily stay, anymore than
      Frankenstein’s monster, or the monsters we create of and for one another.
      It reminds us that art/ make-believe can reach us and lift us and save us
      and make us less alone, but not always, not in the ways we’d like, and not
      permanently. And yet they live on.
  - reviewerName: San Francisco Book Review
    message: Reminiscent of Michelle Tea in subject and humor, and of T.
      Fleischmann’s poeticism in style, this collection continues the work of
      modern queer essayists. The memories it contains, whether false or true,
      rose-colored or traumatic, are all written with stunning honesty.
  - reviewerName: Out in Print
    message: It’s honesty [is what] makes The Fabulous Ekphrastic Fantastic! a great
      read.
  - message: Miah Jeffra writes somewhere between a scream and a growl, in short
      energetic essays that queer the language in exciting ways. In a letter to
      the late Keith Haring, Jeffra writes ‘I want to feel like a bandit, a
      punk, a renegade.’ And indeed he takes us on an outlaw's journey,
      provocateur and picador; flaunt and flirt. Here is a writer who grabs the
      reader by the balls in all the ways one hopes to be testicularly taken.
    reviewerName: D.A. Powell
  - message: Miah Jeffra is that rare writer who’s as committed to the individual
      sentence as much as he is to developing a bold, animated vision. These
      short pieces are nothing less than an ongoing art of survival, and they’re
      irresistible in their force, innovation, and vulnerability.
    reviewerName: Paul Lisicky
  - message: Both tough and tender, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and other times
      direly serious, Miah Jeffra flips the script in these essays on art,
      danger, seduction and sexuality. Moving between critical, narrative,
      lyrical modes Jeffra illuminates and entertains. I loved this book.
    reviewerName: Kazim Ali
  - message: "Miah Jeffra is one of the most interesting writers working today and
      his new book, The Fabulous Ekphrastic Fantastic!, is among the most unique
      you’re likely to pick up this—or any—year. I could describe the book as
      part memoir, part criticism—but that wouldn’t do justice to the electric,
      eclectic way Jeffra straddles and subverts genres. Instead, I’ll suggest
      this: go and read the book and see for yourself. You’ll be happy you did."
    reviewerName: Chanan Tigay
  - reviewerName: "Empty Mirror "
    message: I read The Fabulous Fantastic Ekphrastic! with multiple browser tabs
      open at all times—perhaps the perfect response to modern life that a book
      has ever evoked in me.
